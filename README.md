# TestCaseInspector

## Overview
TestCaseInspector is a tool designed to identify failing test cases by comparing correct and incorrect code implementations using randomly generated test cases. By running a checker.sh script in Git Bash or Hyper Terminal, TestCaseInspector provides insights into where your code is failing, helping you debug and improve your solutions

## File Structure
### correct.cpp: 
The correct code implementation or brute force solution.
### wrong.cpp:
The code implementation that is failing.
### random.cpp: 
Generates random test cases.
### checker.sh: 
Bash script to find and report failing test cases.

## Prerequisites
Git Bash or Hyper Terminal installed on your system.\
C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).\
Basic knowledge of running scripts in a terminal.\
Ensure all files (correct.cpp, wrong.cpp, random.cpp, and checker.sh) are present in the same project directory.\

## usage
Run the Checker Script
Execute the checker.sh script in Git Bash or Hyper Terminal to find the failing test cases.
