# TestCaseInspector

## Overview
TestCaseInspector is a tool designed to identify failing test cases by comparing correct and incorrect code implementations using randomly generated test cases. By running a checker.sh script in Git Bash or Hyper Terminal, TestCaseInspector provides insights into where your code is failing, helping you debug and improve your solutions

## File Structure
### correct.cpp: 
The correct code implementation or brute force solution.
### wrong.cpp:
The code implementation that is failing.
### random.cpp: 
Generates random test cases.
### checker.sh: 
Bash script to find and report failing test cases.
